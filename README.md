> **Zero-Trust Attack Surface Predictor & Autonomous Hardening System**
> *Predicting threats before they happen, hardening systems before they're needed*

## 🚀 Overview

AEGIS-CORE is a revolutionary AI-powered security system that moves beyond reactive defense to predictive, autonomous protection. It uses machine learning to predict attacks before they occur and automatically hardens systems in anticipation.

## ✨ Unique Features

### 🔮 **Predictive Threat Intelligence**
- AI models trained on decades of attack data
- Real-time prediction of attack vectors
- Correlation across dark web, CVEs, and network patterns
- Timeline forecasting for threat development

### 🛡️ **Autonomous System Hardening**
- Dynamic binary fortification with unique security DNA
- Memory obfuscation using post-quantum cryptography
- Process behavioral biometrics for authentication
- Network deception with intelligent honeypots

### 🧠 **AI-Driven Deception**
- Self-learning honeypots that adapt to attackers
- Fake infrastructure that appears real
- Attacker profiling and counter-intelligence
- Automated threat analysis and response

### ⛓️ **Blockchain Integrity**
- Immutable audit trail of all security events
- Proof-of-work verified action logging
- Tamper-evident system state verification
- Distributed threat intelligence sharing

### ⚖️ **Ethical AI Enforcement**
- Built-in ethical constraints and compliance
- Legal framework adherence (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)
- Human oversight requirements
- Transparency and accountability mechanisms
